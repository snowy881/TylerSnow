    <h1> About </h1>
    <p> I wanted to try to create this website to hone my coding skills as well as provide an easy place to update others on the details of my life. </p>
    <p> During high school I worked in a retirement home serving food. That job helped me further develop my communication skills. While attending Grove City College I have earned 4 letters playing soccer for the men's varsity team while working at Sweet Jeanie's, the local ice cream shop. I learned how a start up business works and was able to see it develop over the year that I worked there. During the summer break from college I worked with CollegePro painters as a painter and job-site manager. I was responsible for ensuring customer satisfaction as well as a making a budget. I learned how to cold call as well as valuable leadership experience. My leadership skills were further honed this past summer I interned with Young Life as an intern for their summer servants program in Syracuse, New York. I was responsible for finding sites for the campers to work at as well as running the two one week mission trips for a variety of high schools in the area. I graduated from Slippery Rock University in 2019 with a B.S. in marketing management. Since graduation, I have been working at Plowz & Mowz. My title is Business Development specialist. This role includes: onboarding potential partners, filling a variety of custom orders, upselling current customers as well as securing commercial accounts.</p>
